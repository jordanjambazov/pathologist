In the process of project development multiple failures happen. Those "postmortems" shall be traced
and transform in learned lessons. The focus of the project is to provide a management system for those
postmortems.

The Good Postmortem
-------------------

> A good postmortem should include the following:
> * A brief summary
> * A time line of the event, from discovery through investigation to resolution
> * The primary cause of the event
> * Impact and damage assessment
> * A set of action items to fix the problem immediately
> * A set of action items to prevent the event from happening again
> * Lessons learned
